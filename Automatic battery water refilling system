Description 
The battery water refilling system is an automated solution to the maintenance
of lead-acid batteries through the maintenance of optimum levels of water in the batteries. The device monitors the amount of water available in the batteries. and periodically refills them to ensure that the electrolytes do not run out, which would increase the life expectancy. It integrates sensors, pumps, and a control unit that manages the replenishment of water efficiently.

Components used: XKC Y25 capacitive sensor, Normally Open type solenoid valve, submersible water pump, Arduino UNO, Relay modules.
Code:
const int waterSensorPin = 2; // Pin connected to the sensor
const int pumpRelayPin = 3;   // Pin connected to the pump relay
const int valveRelayPin = 4;  // Pin connected to the valve relay

void setup() {
  pinMode(waterSensorPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(pumpRelayPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(valveRelayPin, OUTPUT);
  
  digitalWrite(pumpRelayPin, LOW); // Ensure pump relay is off
  digitalWrite(valveRelayPin, LOW); // Ensure valve relay is off
  
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = digitalRead(waterSensorPin);
  Serial.print("Sensor Value: ");
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  
  if (sensorValue == LOW) {
    // Water level is low, turn on pump first, then valve
    Serial.println("Water level low. Turning ON Pump");
    digitalWrite(pumpRelayPin, HIGH);
    delay(2000); // Wait 2 seconds to ensure pump is running
    Serial.println("Turning ON Valve");
    digitalWrite(valveRelayPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    // Water level is sufficient, turn off pump and valve
    Serial.println("Water level sufficient. Turning OFF Pump and Valve");
    digitalWrite(pumpRelayPin, LOW);
    digitalWrite(valveRelayPin, LOW);
  }
  
  delay(1000); // Check the water level every second
}
